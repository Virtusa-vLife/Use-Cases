The purpose of this project is to design a model that will predict the insurance amount that a patient can claim for the treatment of a particular disease. Using the mimic database which contains the electronic health records of patients and the claims database which contains the insurance claim records, we will generate a model that will predict the total cost incurred and the amount that can be claimed. This will help the patients get a better picture of the expenditure for the treatment of a disease.

For this purpose, first, an analysis is performed over the claims dataset to get a clear picture of the features involved.
Next, the most important features that are common with the electronic health records is determind using stastical test.
Once the most important features are found out, we used these features to merge the electronic health records with the claims records to impute the total cost of the disease into the electronic health records
After the merging of the databases, we predict the total cost and the payable amount using the electronic health records of the patients.
