    "* 1: Overall, the dataset is quite clean. Each hospital seems to be uniquely identifed by the ProviderID. It would be a good idea to double check if that's the case\n",
    "* 2: Right away, we see there are potential missing values, labeled 'Not Available', that should be considered NA. However, they are technically not read as such. This creates a problem when we want to pass in these values into a predictive model because it would consider these 'Not Available' as real data and not missing values that should be ignored. (Ex. Take a look at Hale County Hospital's hospital rating)\n",
    "* 3: Further note on the categorical data, each variable is written in two variables - one that contains the actual descriptive data and the other that contains additional explanation if the original value was not given or 'Not Available'' in this sense. It seems that the only explanation (so far) for a value that does not have any available data will state \"Results are not available for this reporting...\". For now, I would toss out any variables that have the words \"footnote\" to make our dataset smaller and easier to read because containing these variables results in redundancy. \n",

In a nutshell, it randomly picks a value for each hyperparameter from the ranges given, then performs k crossfold validation using these parameters. It then averages the testing scores.
